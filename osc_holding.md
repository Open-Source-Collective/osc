# OSC Holding 
The [OSC Holding account](https://opencollective.com/osc-holding) is a seperate fund under Open Source Collective to hold collective donations for bank transactions where the intended collective (or sender) can not be identified.

### Why do we have OSC Holding?
We sometimes receive direct deposits to our bank account that have no Order ID associated to them and no previous context or issuing Purchase Order. When this happens, we can not find a matching transaction on the platform and we don't know who the money should be sent to however, it should be set aside because it is intended for a specific project. The OSC Holding account is a way for us to put these funds aside.

### What do we do with the funds in OSC Holding?
When we recieve deposits to our bank account that do not have the Order ID, we do the following to try to resolve the intended donation match
1. Search for a transaction on our platform or in our help desk with any identifying information that may in the description of the transfer
2. If that fails, we send an email to our bank with the description, date and amount of the transaction to find the issuing bank.
3. If we can find the issuing bank, we ask them to help us identify the sender and tell them to cotact us at 'hello@oscollective.org' 

If all that fails, we create a transaction in OSC Holding to match the unidentifiable donation. The funds will sit in OSC Holding until we can resolve where the funds should go

### What is this space for?
This space will be used to document the transactions added to OSC Holding and their status. I hope that all the funds added in a year will be sent out by the end of the year but if not, this will be a good place to be transparant about how we are trying to resolve where the funds should go.
