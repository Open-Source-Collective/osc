# Our Eligibility Criteria 

We accept any open source project, in any language, anywhere in the world. We can also accept projects that are strongly associated with open source projects and communities like meetups and conferences, as well as advocacy groups, research, and awareness initiatives.

If applying as an open source project your project license is critically important. We review licenses on a case-by-case basis when needed but licenses approved by the following bodies will significantly increase the likelihood your project will be approved:  

* [Open Source Initiative Approved Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses);
* [Free Software Foundation License List](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html); 
* [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses); 
* [Fedora Software License List](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing);
* [Open Source Hardware Association Statement of Principles](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/).

We do not accept projects that do not have a recent history of activity or an established base of dependent packages, applications or services. If your project is a fork of an existing repository there should be a material degree of activity and usage _away_ from the forked project. 

We do not accept projects that are hosted under a personal profile. Please make sure your project is hosted under an profile that is not strongly associatated with an individual (i.e. an organisation account).

If you are an open source project with an [SPDX compliant license](https://spdx.org/licenses/), a recent history of activity or a current base of dependents, at least two maintainers, and your project is not associated with an individual user's profile, you will be immediately approved.

If you don’t fit the above requirements, we will consider your application on a case by case basis, using the following criteria:

## Open source projects
If there’s a codebase at the heart of your project, it should meet the crieria above. 

## User groups 
Should have at least 50 members and be able to demonstrate a genuine history of community activity (forum, events, publications, etc).

## Meetups or small event groups 
You should have organized at least 2 events previously, and be able to show a history of activity online and offline. As further evidence, you agree to send photo/video documentation of your first event after joining Open Source Collective.

## Conferences and larger events 
We may require specific risk assessment by our board. No expenses will be paid in advance of sufficient funds being available in the Collective budget (e.g. hiring a venue).All agreements between your Collective and third parties, such as venues, contractors, speakers, etc, require explicit written permission and involvement of the OSC administrators. As fiscal sponsor, such agreements are legally between the third party and Open Source Collective.
